Flexlay
=======

Flexlay is a generic 2d game editor. It currently supports multi
layered tile- and object maps, full undo/redo, support for
tile-brushes, easy copy/paste, multiple buffers, minimap support, a
metadata editor and some other stuff usefull for creating levels for
2d games.

Supported games are at the moment:

 Windstille - http://www.nongnu.org/windstille/
 netPanzer  - http://netpanzer.berlios.de/
 SuperTux   - http://super-tux.sourceforge.net/

Flexlay can't be run on its own, but instead of you have to start it
via wrapper scripts (supertux-editor, windstille-editor,
netpanzer-editor).

For informations on how to compile and run Flexlay see the file
INSTALL. Flexlay makes use of OpenGL so you will need working hardware
3d support.

Flexlay is covered under the GNU GPL, which means that you can copy
and even modify it pretty much as you like, as long as you keep the
copyright headers in place and distribute the source too if you
distribute binaries, see the file COPYING for details.

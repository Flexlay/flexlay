Windstille Installation
=======================

Source
======

The Windstille source is available at the Windstille webpage. To
compile it you need Guile 1.6 and ClanLib 0.7. Compiliation is just a
matter of:

 $ ./configure
 $ make 

then. There is no need to run 'make install', Windstille will run fine
from its the source directory.

Binary
======

The binary is build so that it should run out of the box on any
x86 GNU/Linux system that has hardware 3d support, just run:

 $ ./windstille

to start the binary. Use the '--fullscreen' flag if you want to start
into fullscreen, if you want to use a joystick to play start with
'--controller data/controller/gamepad.scm', if the button
configuration isn't correct you need to change gamepad.scm or pick
another one of the provided controller files.

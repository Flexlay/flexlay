Installing Flexlay 
==================

Requirements:
=============

To compile Flexlay you need a recent ClanLib 0.7, quite often the
latest not-yet-released development version from the subversion tree,
available at:

  * http://www.clanlib.org

And you need scons (a make replacement) available at:

  * http://www.scons.org

If you want to build the SuperTux Editor module you need in addition
to that Ruby, available at and a recent SuperTux version (ie. cvs
version, latest release will most likly not work):

  * http://www.ruby-lang.org

Compilation:
============

Just type:

 $ scons

and it should build everything automatically if the prerequirements
are meet.

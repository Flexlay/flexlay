Windstille Installion
=====================

Binary:
=======

Simply run the 'windstille' script in the top-level directory, if you
have OpenGL installed it should work out of the box without any extra
library requirements. Its important that you run the script, not the
'windstille.static' binary itself, since it might not work that way.


Source:
=======

Windstille requires a CVS version of ClanLib-0.7 and a installation of
Guile 1.6, once you have compiled and installed both a simple:

 % ./configure
 % make 

compiles Windstille, you way than run it by:

 % cd src/
 % ./windstille

Installation is currently not supported.

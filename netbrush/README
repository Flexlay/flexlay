======================================'

netBrush is a network based drawing programming, meaning it allows
multiple people to draw on the same canvas at the same time. The
current feature set of netBrush is limited to a fixed size canvas and
a simple brush tool, changing brush size, hardness, color, opacity,
etc. is possible. 

netBrush is based on SDL and doesn't use any external widget
libraries, so it should be very portable. In addition to the base SDL
library netBrush also uses SDL_net and SDL_image.

Latest version of netBrush can be found at, no real webside exist yet:

 * svn co svn://svn.berlios.de/flexlay/trunk/netbrush/

Question coments can go to the author, who is reachable at

Usage:
~~~~~~

netBrush is client/server based, so to take full use of it, you have
to start the server first, a simple:

./netbrush-server 4711

will do, 4711 being the port number.

To start the client you have to give it a hostname and a port, like
this:

./netbrush-client localhost 4711

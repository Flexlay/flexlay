Windstille Bugs
===============

The game is still in its early phase, so it has quite a few bugs, the
known one include:

 - lack of non-square tiles, so you have to jump even on the smallest
   gradient

 - airwalk, sometimes the hero will walk in the air, instead of on the
   ground

 - buggy collision detection, collision detection currently uses
   bounding-boxes, so its not really preciese, pixel-preciion will
   come with the next release

 - editor crashes, editor isn't testet much, so it might not really
   work well for you

 - controlls, even so the controlls are rather flexible, docu is
   lacking and a gui for configuration would be good
